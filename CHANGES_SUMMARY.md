# Order API Customer Name Response - Changes Summary

## Problem Statement
The Order API was not returning the customer name as a separate field in the response. It was only returning a combined `customerDetails` string, making it difficult for frontend applications to access individual customer information.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced OrderDTO (`src/main/java/com/resadmin/res/dto/OrderDTO.java`)
Added individual customer fields to the response DTO:
- `customerName` - Customer's full name
- `customerPhone` - Customer's phone number
- `customerAddress` - Customer's delivery address (optional)
- `notes` - Special instructions or notes (optional)

The original `customerDetails` field is retained for backward compatibility.

### 2. Updated EntityMapper (`src/main/java/com/resadmin/res/mapper/EntityMapper.java`)
Enhanced the `toOrderDTO()` method to:
- Parse the `customerDetails` string and extract individual fields
- Support the new format: `Name: [name] | Phone: [phone] | Address: [address] | Notes: [notes]`
- Maintain backward compatibility with legacy format: `[name], [phone], [email]`

Added helper methods:
- `extractCustomerField()` - Extracts fields from the new pipe-separated format
- `handleLegacyFormat()` - Falls back to parsing comma-separated legacy format

### 3. Updated Sample Data (`src/main/resources/data.sql`)
Updated sample orders to use the new format with proper field labels for consistency.

### 4. Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation:
- `docs/ORDER_API_RESPONSE_CHANGES.md` - Detailed API changes documentation

## Key Features

### ✅ Individual Customer Fields
API responses now include parsed customer fields, making frontend integration easier.

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
The original `customerDetails` field is still included, ensuring existing integrations continue to work.

### ✅ Legacy Data Support
Automatically detects and parses both new and old data formats, ensuring compatibility with existing database records.

### ✅ No Database Migration Required
Changes are implemented at the DTO/mapping layer only, requiring no schema changes.

## Example Response

**Before:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "customerDetails": "Name: John Doe | Phone: 555-1234",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "totalPrice": 45.97,
  ...
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "customerPhone": "555-1234",
  "customerAddress": "123 Main Street",
  "notes": "Please ring doorbell",
  "customerDetails": "Name: John Doe | Phone: 555-1234 | Address: 123 Main Street | Notes: Please ring doorbell",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "totalPrice": 45.97,
  ...
}
```

## Affected Endpoints

All Order API endpoints that return order data now include the enhanced fields:
- GET /api/orders
- GET /api/orders/{id}
- GET /api/orders/status/{status}
- GET /api/orders/kitchen
- GET /api/orders/delivery
- GET /api/orders/ready-for-delivery
- GET /api/orders/today
- GET /api/orders/date-range
- POST /api/orders (response)
- PUT /api/orders/{id} (response)
- PATCH /api/orders/{id}/status (response)

## Testing

The implementation includes robust parsing logic that:
1. Correctly extracts fields from the new pipe-separated format
2. Falls back to legacy format when new format is not detected
3. Handles missing optional fields gracefully
4. Returns null for fields that are not present

## Benefits

1. **Improved API Usability**: Frontend applications can directly access customer name without string parsing
2. **Better Data Structure**: Structured fields instead of free-form text
3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing integrations continue to work
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more fields in the future
5. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
