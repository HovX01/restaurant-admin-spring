# Payment Management Feature - Changes Summary

## Overview

The Restaurant Administration System has been enhanced with comprehensive payment management functionality. This feature allows tracking of payment status and payment methods for all orders.

## Problem Statement

The previous system lacked the ability to:
- Track whether an order has been paid or not
- Record which payment method was used
- Filter orders by payment status
- Generate payment-related reports

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**Modified Table**: `orders`

Added fields:
```sql
is_paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT false NOT NULL
payment_method VARCHAR(20) CHECK (payment_method IN ('CASH_ON_DELIVERY', 'BANK', 'CARD'))
```

Added indexes:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_is_paid ON orders(is_paid);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_payment_method ON orders(payment_method);
```

### 2. Entity Layer Updates

**Order Entity** (`src/main/java/com/resadmin/res/entity/Order.java`):
- Added `isPaid` field (Boolean, default: false)
- Added `paymentMethod` field (Enum)
- Added `PaymentMethod` enum with values: CASH_ON_DELIVERY, BANK, CARD
- Added getters and setters for new fields
- Updated toString() method

### 3. DTO Layer Updates

**OrderDTO** (`src/main/java/com/resadmin/res/dto/OrderDTO.java`):
- Added `isPaid` field
- Added `paymentMethod` field

**CreateOrderRequestDTO** (`src/main/java/com/resadmin/res/dto/request/CreateOrderRequestDTO.java`):
- Added `paymentMethod` field to support setting payment method during order creation

**New DTO Created**: `UpdatePaymentRequestDTO`
- `isPaid`: Required field for payment status
- `paymentMethod`: Optional field for payment method

### 4. Mapper Updates

**EntityMapper** (`src/main/java/com/resadmin/res/mapper/EntityMapper.java`):
- Updated `toOrderDTO()` to include payment fields
- Updated `toOrderEntity()` to set payment method and initialize isPaid to false

### 5. Repository Layer Updates

**OrderRepository** (`src/main/java/com/resadmin/res/repository/OrderRepository.java`):

New query methods:
- `findByIsPaid(Boolean isPaid)` - Find orders by payment status
- `findByPaymentMethod(PaymentMethod paymentMethod)` - Find orders by payment method
- `findByIsPaidAndStatus(Boolean isPaid, OrderStatus status)` - Combined filter

### 6. Service Layer Enhancements

**OrderService** (`src/main/java/com/resadmin/res/service/OrderService.java`):

New methods:
- `updatePaymentStatus(orderId, isPaid, paymentMethod)` - Update payment details
- `markOrderAsPaid(orderId, paymentMethod)` - Convenience method to mark as paid
- `markOrderAsUnpaid(orderId)` - Mark order as unpaid
- `getPaidOrders()` - Retrieve all paid orders
- `getUnpaidOrders()` - Retrieve all unpaid orders
- `getOrdersByPaymentMethod(paymentMethod)` - Filter by payment method

### 7. Controller Layer Enhancements

**OrderController** (`src/main/java/com/resadmin/res/controller/OrderController.java`):

New endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| PATCH | `/api/orders/{id}/payment` | Update payment status and method |
| POST | `/api/orders/{id}/mark-paid` | Mark order as paid |
| POST | `/api/orders/{id}/mark-unpaid` | Mark order as unpaid |
| GET | `/api/orders/paid` | Get all paid orders |
| GET | `/api/orders/unpaid` | Get all unpaid orders |
| GET | `/api/orders/payment-method/{method}` | Get orders by payment method |

All endpoints include:
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Role-based access control (ADMIN, MANAGER)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper HTTP status codes

### 8. Documentation Updates

**README.md**:
- Added payment management to core features
- Added new payment endpoints to API documentation
- Added payment operations section with examples
- Enhanced database schema documentation
- Added payment status in order response examples

**New Documentation File**: `docs/PAYMENT_MANAGEMENT.md`
- Comprehensive payment feature documentation
- API usage examples
- Business logic workflows
- Integration guidelines
- Best practices

## Key Features

### ✅ Payment Status Tracking
Orders can be marked as paid or unpaid with a simple boolean flag.

### ✅ Multiple Payment Methods
Support for three payment methods:
- **CASH_ON_DELIVERY**: Payment collected upon delivery
- **BANK**: Bank transfer or online banking
- **CARD**: Credit/debit card payment

### ✅ Flexible API
Multiple endpoints for different use cases:
- Quick mark as paid/unpaid
- Detailed payment update with method
- Filter orders by payment status
- Filter orders by payment method

### ✅ Real-time Updates
Payment status changes trigger WebSocket notifications for immediate updates.

### ✅ Role-based Access
Only ADMIN and MANAGER roles can modify payment status.

### ✅ Backward Compatible
- Existing orders default to unpaid
- All existing endpoints continue to work
- New fields added to responses

## API Examples

### Create Order with Payment Method

```bash
POST /api/orders
{
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "customerPhone": "555-1234",
  "paymentMethod": "CARD",
  "totalAmount": 25.99,
  "items": [...]
}
```

### Update Payment Status

```bash
PATCH /api/orders/1/payment
{
  "isPaid": true,
  "paymentMethod": "BANK"
}
```

### Mark as Paid

```bash
POST /api/orders/1/mark-paid?paymentMethod=CASH_ON_DELIVERY
```

### Get Unpaid Orders

```bash
GET /api/orders/unpaid
```

## Response Format

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "status": "CONFIRMED",
  "totalPrice": 25.99,
  "isPaid": true,
  "paymentMethod": "CARD",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  ...
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Payment Tracking**: Know which orders are paid and which need follow-up
2. **Payment Method Analytics**: Track customer payment preferences
3. **Better Financial Management**: Easy reporting on paid vs unpaid orders
4. **COD Support**: Proper handling of cash-on-delivery orders
5. **Flexible Integration**: Multiple endpoints for different use cases
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket notifications for payment changes
7. **Secure**: Role-based access control for payment operations

## Database Migration

### Automatic Schema Update
- JPA/Hibernate automatically adds new columns
- Default values set for existing records
- No manual migration required

### Existing Data
- All existing orders: `isPaid = false`
- All existing orders: `paymentMethod = null`
- No data loss or corruption

## Testing Considerations

1. Test payment status updates
2. Test payment method selection
3. Test filtering by paid/unpaid status
4. Test filtering by payment method
5. Test role-based access control
6. Test WebSocket notifications
7. Test backward compatibility

## Security Considerations

- Payment operations restricted to ADMIN and MANAGER roles
- All operations require JWT authentication
- Payment changes logged via WebSocket
- No sensitive payment data stored (card numbers, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Payment transaction history
- Partial payment support
- Payment gateway integration
- Refund tracking
- Automated payment reminders
- Payment analytics dashboard
